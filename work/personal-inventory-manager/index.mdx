## Project Overview

**PIM** is a mobile application built with React Native and Ruby on Rails. It allows users to create an inventory of items, keep track of each item's location, and add metadata to the items and their containers.

I developed this app as my final project for Flatiron School. My class happened to have an unofficial extra week to work on projects during a holiday break and I decided to learn the React Native framework during this time.

### Here's a demo of PIM from the Flatiron School Science Fair:

I also learned how to use Android Studio in the process of creating this app. It was so much fun learning new technology and incorporating it with the skills I had already gained in the program.
