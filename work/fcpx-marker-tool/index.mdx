## Project Overview

Final Cut Pro X is an awesome video editing tool, but it's still missing a key feature that was present in FCP7: the ability to export Chapter Marker information.

To solve this I created FCPX Marker Tool. Written in Python, it allows users to parse, display, and save marker metadata from FCPXML files. It supports both the older .fcpxml and newer .fcpxmld formats.

### FCPX Marker Tool in Action

Version 2 has now been released and was completely re-written, allowing for more parsers and export options to be easily added. One notable addition is the ability to export a YouTube chapter list.

Combining my experience in both video editing and software development was really fun as I worked on this project, and I've even been able to use it for several client video projects.

### What I Learned While Working on This Project

FCPX Marker Tool was actually one of the first entries into an "App Ideas" list I started several years before learning to code, and I learned so many great lessons working on this project.

**Some notable topics I learned about included:**
- Parsing XML files using the xml.etree.ElementTree module
- Examining how Apple structures data in FCPXML files
- Using rational numbers to store timecode data more accurately.<br></br>**Ex:** representing the frame rate of 23.976 as (24000/1001).
- Properly structuring a Python project:
  - Setting up a virtual environment
  - Creating a setup.py file for configuring version information and entry points
